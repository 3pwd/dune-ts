Work in Progress.  
Unofficial Dune Analytics Typescript Client.

## Motivation

Dune Analytics is a great tool for querying blockchain data.
However, it is currently only browser based which is not very developer friendly. An official API is being developed but is only opened in [private beta](https://dune.com/docs/api/).
This library aims to provide an alternative way to integrate Dune Analytics into your Typescript projects.

## Features

- [ ] Authentication with password and username.
- [ ] Fetch results from Dune Analytics queries.

## Installation

```commandline
pnpm install dune-ts
```

## Setup

Fill your credentials in `.config.yaml`.  
See [`.config.example.yaml`](.config.yaml) for an example.
